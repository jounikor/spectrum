The two following Python3 programs implement my ANS ancoders/decoders. These
are simple and should be very readable, since they were implemented for my
ANS concept self-learning purposes.

  rans.py - An example implementation of rANS encoder and decoder.
  tans.py - An example implementation of tANS encoder and decoder.

The following C++ (v11 should be enough) program implement a tANS encoder
and decoder template classes. These classes are purposely designed to mimic
low spec target platforms - read 8-bit systems.

  tans.cpp - An example driver program for encoding/decoding.
  ans.h - The base class for encoder/decoder template classes.
  tans_encoder.h - tANS encoder template class.
  tans_decoder.h - tANS decoder templets class that does NOT use k-table.
  tans_decoder_k.h - tANS decoder templete class that uses k-table.
  trace.h - Some tracing macros.

The following Z80 assembly file implements a tANS decoder and a required
function for building L- and Y-value decoding tables. The implementation 
currently is 86 bytes, excluding L- and Y-tables.
