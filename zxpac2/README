zxpac2 v0.21

CHANGES from v0.2
* Self-extracting decruncher support, see '--exe' switch. The file has to loaded
  into that memory address the file will be decrunched.
* Inplace decrunching fix - added '--inplace' switch that adds extra information
  into the crunched file that helps ensuring the inplace decrunching works.
* The cruncher will inform you when inplace decrunching must be done
* When the file is crunched with '--inplace' the INPLACE equ must be set 1 in the
  supplied z80dec.asm decruncher code.
* Inplace crunched files must be decrunched inplace as well if the cruncher so
  informs after crunching.

TODO:
* New matching algorithm to replace the current non-greedy algorithm with something
  better.


USAGE:
Usage: zxpac2 [options] infile outfile
 Options:
  --gry       Selects greedy matching
  --lzy       Selects lazy evaluation matching
  --non       Selects non-greedy matching (defaults to 8)
  --debug     Print debug output (will be plenty)
  --len num   Selects non-greedy matching with num distance
  --exe load,jump,page Self-extracting decruncher parameters
  --inplace   Ensure inplace decrunching

Note that 'load' and 'jump' are 16 bit hexadecimal numbers. 'page' is a 
8 bit hexadecimal numner. Prefixes like '0x' or '$' are not needed.
The '--exe' switch implicitly adds '--inplace'.
