zxpac2 v0.21

CHANGES from v0.2
* Inplace decrunching fix - added '--inplace' switch that adds extra information
  into the crunched file that helps ensuring the inplace decrunching works.
* The cruncher will inform you when inplace decrunching must be done
* When the file is crunched with '--inplace' the INPLACE equ must be set 1 in the
  supplied z80dec.asm decruncher code.
* Inplace crunched files must be decrunched inplace as well if the cruncher so
  informs after crunching.

TODO:
* New matching algorithm to replace the current non-greedy algorithm with something
  better.
* Add "exe decruncher" stub support.
